PHPstagram

We had a lot of fun coding this project and it is probably the most complex and best working web app I have made. I added most of the php logic and functionality for registration, login, uploading, and liking a picture. My partner Jacqueline has a better eye for ux design so she designed the wireframes and nav bar.

However we did have some shortcomings - first, sending mail with php seemed virtually impossible. To use the built in mail() function we needed to modify the php.ini file which we don't have access to because it is hosted on the school server. We tried to use formsubmit.io but that wouldn't work with our login system. I even downloaded other php mail libraries but couldn't get those working so we just had to chalk this part of the app :(

Second, originally we planned on users being able to comment on pictures and follow other users. We have an idea of how to go about this but simply were not able to due to lack of time. With more time this is definitely something that would be incorporated in our app.
